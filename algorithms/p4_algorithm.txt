P4 Vernam Cipher

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the message
Step 3: Convert message to plaintext by removing spaces
        and making each character uppercase.
Step 4: Set len = length of plaintext
Step 5: XOR each character code of plaintext with a randomly 
        generated key character.
            For i from 0 to len - 1, do
                pi = code of plaintext[i]
                ki = random number between 0 and 25
                ci = pi XOR ki
                If ci > 25, then
                    Set ci = ci - 26
                end if
                ciphertext[i] = character of ci
                key[i] = character of ki
            end for
Step 6: Print the ciphertext
Step 7: Print the key
Step 8: STOP
