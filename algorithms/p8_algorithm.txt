Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the value of prime modulus p. Check if entered
        value is prime
            If p <= 1, then
                p is not prime
                Go to step 11
            Else
                For i from 2 to sqrt(n), do
                    If p MOD i = 0, then
                        p is not prime
                        Go to step 11
                End for
                p is prime
Step 3: Find the base g as primitive root modulo p
            For g from 2 to p - 1, do
                flag = 1
                For i from 1 to p - 2, do
                    If g^i MOD p = 1, then
                        flag = 0
                        break
                    End if
                End for
                If flag = 1, then
                    g is the required primitive root
                    Go to step 4
                End if
            End for
            g not available for p
            Go to step 11
Step 4: Alice chooses random secret key a in the range 1 to p - 2
Step 5: Alice calculates her public key A as
            A = g^a MOD p
Step 6: Bob chooses random secret key b in the range 1 to p - 2
Step 7: Bob calculates his public key B as
            B = g^b MOD p
Step 8: Both public keys are exchanged.
Step 9: Alice calculates the shared secret as
            s = B^a MOD p
Step 10: Bob calculates the shared secret as
            s = A^b MOD p
Step 11: STOP
