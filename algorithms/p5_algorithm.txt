P5 Hill Cipher

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the 9 key characters for 3x3 key matrix to key_string.
            k = 0
            For i from 0 to 2, do
                For j from 0 to 2, do
                    key[i][j] = code of uppercase key_string[k]
                    k = k + 1
                end for
            end for
Step 3: Read the 3 message characters to message.
            For i from 0 to 2, do
                pvector[i] = code of uppercase message[i]
            end for
Step 4: Do matrix multiplication with key matrix and pvector.
        Store the results to cvector.
            For i from 0 to 2, do
                cvector[i] = 0
                For k from 0 to 2, do
                    cvector[i] = cvector + key[i][k] * pvector[k]
                end for
                cvector[i] = cvector[i] % 26
            end for
Step 5: Print the ciphertext.
            For i from 0 to 2, do
                Print the character value of cvector[i]
            end for
Step 6: STOP
