P3 Caesar Cipher

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the message
Step 3: Read the key
Step 4: Convert message to plaintext by removing spaces
        and making each character uppercase.
Step 5: Set len = length of plaintext
Step 6: Do modular addition using key and each character code
        of plaintext.
            For i from 0 to len - 1, do
                pi = code of plaintext[i]
                ci = (pi + key) % 26
                ciphertext[i] = character of ci
            end for
Step 7: Print the ciphertext
Step 8: STOP
