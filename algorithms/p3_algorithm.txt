P3 Caesar Cipher

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the message
Step 3: Read the key
Step 4: Set len = length of message
Step 5: Do modular addition using key and character code for
        every alphabet character of message.
            For i from 0 to len - 1, do
                If message[i] is an alphabet, then
                    pi = code of message[i]
                    ci = (pi + key) % 26
                    ciphertext[i] = character of ci
                Else
                    ciphertext[i] = message[i]
                end if
            end for
Step 6: Print the ciphertext
Step 7: STOP
