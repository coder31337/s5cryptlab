P7 Diffie Hellman

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Set values of modulus p and base g. g must be a primitive
        root mod p.
Step 3: Alice chooses secret key a.
Step 4: Alice calculates her public key A as
            A = g^a mod p
Step 5: Bob chooses secret key b.
Step 6: Bob calculates his public key B as
            B = g^b mod p
Step 7: Both public keys are exchanged.
Step 8: Alice calculates the shared secret as
            s = B^a mod p
Step 9: Bob calculates the shared secret as
            s = A^b mod p
Step 10: STOP
